Outbreak investigation using Machine Learning.

You are given a data set consisting of DNA sequences (dataset.fas) of the same length. Each DNA sequence is a string of characters from the alphabet ‘A’,’C’,’T’,’G’, and it represents a particular viral strain sampled from an infected individual. Your goal is to write a code that helps to identify transmission clusters corresponding to outbreaks.
The sequences should be considered as feature vectors and characters - as features.  The data set is stored as a fasta file, which is essentially a text file that has the following form:
>Name of Sequence1
AAGCACAGGATGTAATGGTGGGGCCGACCGCCTATTATTCTGATGATTACTTGAGGCCCTCGGAGAGGAAGGGG
>Name of Sequence2
AAGCACAGGATGTAATGGTGGGGCCGACCGCCTATTATTCTGATGATTACTTGAGGCCCTCGGAGAGGAAGGGG
>Name of Sequence3
AAGCACAGGATGTAATGGTGGGGCCGACCGCCTATTATTCTGATGATTACTTGAGGCCCTCGGAGAGGAAGGGG
…..
Here each line starting with ‘>’ symbol contains the name of a sequence followed by the sequence itself in the next line. 

The code has the following steps:
1) Read sequences from the file.
2) Calculate pairwise distances between sequences. Use Hamming distance: it is the number of positions at which the sequences are different 
3) Project the sequences in 2-D space using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) based on Hamming distance matrix.
4) Plot the obtained 2-D data points. Estimate the number of clusters K by visual inspection. 
5) Use k-means algorithm to cluster the 2-D data points.
